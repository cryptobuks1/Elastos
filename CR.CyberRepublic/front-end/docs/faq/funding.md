## FAQ - General

#### How much funding is available?

As written in the Cyber Republic Constitution, each year the council has discretion to spend 10% of the remaining ELA allocated to Cyber Republic.
At the start this is a bit over 1.6 million ELA, there is no requirement to spend all of it. We absolutely advocate spending the funds wisely.

#### Is the funding given all at once or based on milestones?

There is no explicit rule but the Secretariat Team will consist of various experts in their own field, especially investment. In that sense
it can be assumed that everything will be done to minimize the risk to Elastos, including attaching funding to certain milestones and deliverables.

If this isn't being upheld the community can always vote on an amendment to the constitution to be changed.

#### How does the Council ensure that the funds are spent properly?

#### When till the Council start selecting Suggestions and adding Proposals?

Right now the interim CR Council has discretion to create proposals and spend 1 million of ELA from the Elastos Foundation private mining rewards.

However because the interim council was not elected by the community they will be reliant on the popularity of Suggestions to make decisions
They are doing this for obvious reasons
