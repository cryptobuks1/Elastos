## Creating a New Base of Operations for CR in Asia

The year 2020 will be a pivotal year where Elastos and Cyber Republic can grow exponentially with the launch of the
Cyber Republic Consensus project and a new CR Council of 12 elected representatives for the Elastos community.

To spur growth of Elastos, Cyber Republic, and blockchain technology in Asia and beyond, Clarence Liu from Elastos and
Bitwork will join forces to create a strong council committee, which focuses on driving the development and marketing of
cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain communities.


## The Council Committee

All three members will run as one CR Council candidate and draw on our extensive experience to collaborate and vote on
proposals.

    the region.

## Founding Principles

Bitwork has first-hand experience working with the original CR Suggestion & Proposal process, along with Clarence, we
believe that even if we are decentralized, Elastos needs strong leadership to succeed in the competitive and fast-moving
blockchain space, especially in Asia. Together we believe we can bring strong business and blockchain acumen to Cyber
Republic and be a prominent force in the Elastos ecosystem.

### Active Business Development

Bitwork and Clarence already actively work in the blockchain business development space and will continually explore,
find and bring new projects to the Elastos ecosystem and Cyber Republic for potential funding, incubation and acceleration.

### Agile and Data-Driven Marketing

We believe in a dynamic and consistent marketing effort where our strategies are constantly examined based on real-data
feedback to allow us to achieve the greatest effect with minimal costs. We understand that the CR funds are a finite
resource and we must make smart decisions on marketing. Real growth will only be achieved if we can exponentially grow
the community and exposure of Elastos.

### Proper Balance of Funding and Liquidity

The selling pressure caused by CRC will undoubtedly be a major concern. With our business experience and technical know
how, we will closely monitor the market and projects to ensure additional sources of liquidity or demand accompany any
expenditures.
