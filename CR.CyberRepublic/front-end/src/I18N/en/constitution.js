        <p>ARTICLE 5 - COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Elastos is an open-sourced platform founded by the Elastos Foundation. As the project progresses and the community develops, the Elastos Foundation gradually brings community operations to community members and committees.</li>
        <li>Of the 33,000,000 ELA coins created in the Elastos Genesis Block, the Elastos Foundation chose to commit 16,500,000 coins towards development of the Elastos Ecosystem. These coins will be used as rewards for contributions made to the Elastos ecosystem, and their allocation will be decided by the community itself through the Cyber Republic Council, described in Article 6 of this Constitution.</li>
        <li>Every year, an additional 4% of the initial 33,000,000 ELA coins will be created, to ensure a healthy rate of coin supply inflation, incentivize network support, and to fund Cyber Republic projects. Of these additional coins, 30% will be given to the Cyber Republic Council as additional assets to manage in developing the Elastos Ecosystem.</li>
        <li>The digital assets managed by the Elastos Foundation are limited to those NEO/ETH tokens raised during token sales, and the ELA allocated to the Elastos Foundation as described in the White Paper.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ARTICLE 6 - CYBER REPUBLIC COUNCIL</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The Cyber Republic Council is the vehicle through which the Elastos community decides how to manage the funds intended for the development the Elastos ecosystem.</li>
        <li>The Cyber Republic Council is governed by two separate documents: the Cyber Republic Council Founding Document and the Cyber Republic Council Conflict of Interest Policy.</li>
        <li>Community voting will be governed by a separate document, the Elastos Community Voting Rules, to be released by the end of the Interim Period.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ARTICLE 7 - COMMUNITY VOTING</p>
        <p>While the Cyber Republic Council is presently composed of 3 representatives from the Elastos Foundation, the Cyber Republic Council shall consist of members elected by the Elastos community once the Interim Period is complete. There will be specific rules that specify the requirements for electing Cyber Republic Council members, amending the Constitution, and voting on projects to be funded by the Cyber Republic.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 8 - AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION</p>
        <p>In the case of voting to amend the Constitution, voting shall follow the process as outlined in the Elastos Community Voting Rules, with the following exception. Amending the Constitution requires the following threshold:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>ELA participating in voting accounting for more than 30% of circulated ELA by the deadline of such voting;</li>
        <li>Support of 66.67% of the votes represented by ELA participating in voting.</li>
        </ol>
