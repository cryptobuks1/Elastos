# ELA Arbiter

The arbiter is also known as the dPoS nodes, they handle the cross-chain transactions between the mainchain and the sidechains.

### Keystore Creation

The first thing you need to do is create `keystore.dat` files based on the number of arbiter nodes and sidechains.

?> Each arbiter node needs a primary `keystore.dat` (filename must be exactly that) and another `keystore-x.dat` for each sidechain (this can be named anything).

**Steps:**

1. Copy `ela-cli` executable from `Elastos.ELA.Client`



### Setup

1. Install dependencies `glide cc && glide update && glide install`
