## 於亞洲建立全新營運基地

2020年將是關鍵的一年，隨著「Cyber Republic Consensus」項目的開始，以及由12位新當選委員代表組成的Elastos社區 - Cyber Republic(簡稱CR)，
Elastos與Cyber Republic將加速發展業務，持續成長。

為了支持Elastos、Cyber Republic和亞洲區塊鏈技術的發展和增長，來自Elastos的Clarence Liu 將與Bitwork聯手，創建强大的理事會委員會，
著眼於亞洲和其他地區，推動交易平台和區塊鏈社區的發展及營銷。

## Founding Principles

Bitwork has first-hand experience working with the original CR Suggestion & Proposal process, along with Clarence we
believe that even if we are decentralized, Elastos needs strong leadership to succeed in the competitive and fast
moving blockchain space, especially in Asia. Together we believe we can bring strong business and blockchain acumen to
Cyber Republic and be a prominent force in the Elastos ecosystem.

### Active Business Development

Bitwork and Clarence already actively work in the blockchain business development space and will continually explore,
find and bring new projects to the Elastos ecosystem and Cyber Republic for potential funding, incubation and acceleration.

### Agile and Data-Driven Marketing

We believe in a dynamic and consistent marketing effort where our strategies are constantly examined based on real-data
feedback to allow us to achieve the greatest effect with minimal costs. We understand that the CR funds are a finite
resource and we must make smart decisions on marketing. Real growth will only be achieved if we can exponentially
grow the community and exposure of Elastos.

### Proper Balance of Funding and Liquidity

The selling pressure caused by CRC will undoubtedly be a major concern. With our business experience and technical
know how we will closely monitor the market and projects to ensure additional sources of liquidity or demand accompany
any expenditures.
